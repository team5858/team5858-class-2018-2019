# The FRC 2019 Competition Robot

This is the repository for code and documentation.

This code is in "hello world" state right now. The basic command framework is in place, and the
autonomous command blinks the red LED 4 times.

TODO

  - Figure out why the laptops can't push code to the robot
  - Write commands to map the LEDs to the joystick buttons
  - Write drive-train code and drive the platform around
